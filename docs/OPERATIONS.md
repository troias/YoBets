### Config stored in Admin (not env vars)

These live in the database and can be changed from `/admin` without a redeploy:

- `THE_ODDS_API_KEY` — can be set here instead of env
- `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` — Discord channel webhook
- `affiliate_sportsbet`, `affiliate_tab`, etc. — your bookmaker tracking URLs
- `clicks_sportsbet`, `clicks_tab`, etc. — auto-incremented, read-only

---

## 3. Affiliate Programs

### How it works

Every "Bet →" button on the site sends the user to `/api/bet?bm=sportsbet`. That route:
1. Looks up `affiliate_sportsbet` in Admin config
2. If set → redirects to your affiliate tracking URL (your CPA/revenue share link)
3. If not set → redirects to the generic Sportsbet rugby-league page
4. Increments the click counter shown in Admin

You see the click counts in Admin → Affiliate Links. The bookmaker's own affiliate dashboard shows conversions (signups + deposits).

### Sign-up checklist

Work through these in order — Sportsbet and Ladbrokes have the largest user bases in Australia.

**Sportsbet**
- Program: Sportsbet Affiliates
- URL: https://affiliates.sportsbet.com.au
- Commission: CPA ~$120–180 AUD per depositing customer
- Approval time: 3–7 days

**Ladbrokes**
- Program: Income Access (used by Ladbrokes + Neds + others)
- URL: https://www.ladbrokesaffiliates.com.au
- Note: one application covers both Ladbrokes and Neds
- Commission: CPA or revenue share

**Unibet**
- Program: Kindred Affiliates (global program, AU supported)
- URL: https://www.kindredaffiliates.com
- Commission: revenue share 20–30% of net losses

**Betfair**
- Program: Betfair Affiliates AU
- URL: https://affiliates.betfair.com.au
- Note: Betfair is an exchange, not a bookmaker — users who exchange bet bring recurring revenue share

**PointsBet**
- URL: https://affiliates.pointsbet.com.au

**TAB**
- URL: https://www.tab.com.au/affiliates (check for current program)

**Betr / BetRight / PlayUp / TABtouch**
- Smaller books — sign up after the big ones are live

### Pasting your tracking URL

1. Get approved and generate your tracking link (looks like `https://record.sportsbet.com.au/?aid=12345&c=nrl-odds`)
2. Go to Admin → Affiliate Links
3. Paste the link in the input next to the bookmaker
4. Click Save — goes live immediately, no redeploy

---

## 4. Discord Setup

### What you're building

- A free Discord server for your community
- A `#free-alerts` channel that the app posts to automatically after every odds poll
- Alerts include: arb opportunities found, EV bets, steam moves

### Step by step

**1. Create the server**
- discord.com → + (add server) → Create My Own → For a club or community
- Name it: `EdgeBoard` or `NRL Sharp Betting` or similar

**2. Create channels**
- `#welcome` — pin your site link and a short intro
- `#free-alerts` — the app posts here automatically
- `#arb-alerts` — optional, dedicated arb channel
- `#general` — community chat

**3. Get the webhook URL**
- Right-click on `#free-alerts` → Edit Channel → Integrations → Webhooks → New Webhook
- Name it `EdgeBoard Bot`, copy the webhook URL

**4. Paste into Admin**
- Admin → App Config → Discord → Webhook URL → paste → Save
- The worker will post to this channel after the next poll cycle

### What gets posted

After each poll, the worker posts a Discord embed with:
- Number of odds updated
- Any arb opportunities found (match, ROI%)
- Next poll time

### Discord strategy

- Keep `#free-alerts` open to everyone (free users see the signal, want the full tool)
- Use it as a funnel: "see something you like? Full arb finder + EV + line movement at edgeboard.com.au"
- Don't gate the Discord — the website is the paid product

## 5. Stripe

### Setup checklist

1. **Create a Stripe account** at stripe.com
2. **Create a product**: Dashboard → Products → Add Product → name it "EdgeBoard Pro"
3. **Add a price**: $19.00 AUD / month recurring
4. **Copy the Price ID** (starts with `price_`) — this goes in `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_MONTHLY`
5. **Copy API keys**: Dashboard → Developers → API Keys
   - Publishable key: starts with `pk_live_` (put in `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` in admin)
   - Secret key: starts with `sk_live_` (put in `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` in admin)
6. **Set up webhook**: Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks → Add endpoint
   - URL: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
   - Events to listen for: `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - Copy the signing secret → `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in admin

### Test it

Go to `/settings` as a logged-in user, click "Go Pro →". If Stripe is configured, it opens the Stripe checkout. Use test card `4242 4242 4242 4242` in test mode.

### Check health

Admin → Stripe Health — all 4 dots should be green before launch.

## 6. Launching

### Where to post

| Community | Link | What to say |
|---|---|---|
| r/NRL | reddit.com/r/NRL | Lead with value, not promo |
| r/sportsbetting | reddit.com/r/sportsbetting | Explain the arb finder — people love this |
| NRL Twitter/X | Search `#NRL` `#NRLbetting` | Short + punchy, screenshot the arb finder |
| Facebook NRL groups | Search "NRL tips" on Facebook | More casual audience, great for reach |
| Punters Lounge forum | puntersonline.com.au | Serious AU bettors |

### What to post (example)

> Built a free NRL odds comparison tool that finds arbitrage opportunities across 11 Australian bookmakers in real time.
>
> Shows best available odds, flags when books disagree by >8%, and has an EV finder with no-vig fair pricing.
>
> Free to use — just sign up. Link: [your URL]

**Tips:**
- Screenshot the arb finder showing a real opportunity — visual proof beats a description
- Post during Thursday night / Sunday afternoon (pre-game buzz, people are checking odds)
- Don't use "guaranteed profit" language — Reddit mods will remove it. Say "risk-free returns" or "price inefficiencies"

### What you need before posting

- [ ] Domain is live (not localhost)
- [ ] Sign-up works end-to-end
- [ ] At least one round of NRL odds loaded (worker has run once)
- [ ] Discord is live so you can link to it in comments

---

## 7. The Odds API

**Site:** the-odds-api.com

**What it provides:** Live NRL odds from Sportsbet, TAB, Ladbrokes, Neds, PointsBet, Unibet, BetRight, Betr, Betfair, TABtouch, PlayUp.

### Costs

| Plan | Requests/month | Monthly cost |
|---|---|---|
| Free | 500 | $0 |
| Starter | 30,000 | ~$49 USD |
| Standard | 100,000 | ~$99 USD |

Each poll cycle consumes approximately 3–6 API requests (one per market type × bookmaker batch).

At 30-second polling intervals: ~2 requests/minute × 60 × 24 × 30 = ~86,400 requests/month → Standard plan.

At 2-minute intervals (current default): ~21,600 requests/month → Starter plan.

### Configuring the key

Admin → App Config → The Odds API → paste key → Save.

---

## 8. Worker

The worker polls bookmakers and writes odds to the database.

### Modes (set in Admin → Worker Mode)

| Mode | Poll intervals | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| **Production** | 2/5/15/60 min based on match proximity | Always, in production |
| **Slow / Dev** | 12/30/90 min / 6h | Local dev, or to save API quota |
| **Off** | Pauses for 24h, then re-checks | Maintenance, or if API quota runs out |

### Running the worker

**On Railway (recommended):**
- Deploy as a separate service pointing to `src/workers/odds-ingestion-worker.ts`
- Set all the same env vars as the main Next.js app
- Set `REDIS_URL` to a Railway Redis addon

**Via cron (simpler, no Redis needed):**
- Point cron-job.org (free) at `POST https://yourdomain.com/api/cron`
- Header: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET`
- Interval: every 2 minutes
- This triggers a single poll cycle on each hit

**Manual trigger:**
- Admin → Worker Mode → Trigger Now button

---

## 9. Push Notifications

Browser push alerts for arbs, steam moves, etc.

### Generate VAPID keys (one-time setup)

```bash
npx web-push generate-vapid-keys
```

Copy the output:
- `Public Key` → `NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` in `.env.local` and hosting env
- `Private Key` → `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` in `.env.local` and hosting env (keep secret)

These never change — generate once, store both somewhere safe.

---

## 10. Email Alerts

Uses **Resend** to send arb and steam-move alerts to users who enable them.

1. Sign up at resend.com (free tier: 3,000 emails/month)
2. Create an API key
3. Admin → App Config → Resend → paste key → Save
4. Verify your sending domain in Resend dashboard (or use `onboarding@resend.dev` for testing)

---

1. Sign up at twilio.com
2. Get a trial number (free), or buy an AU number (~$2/month)
3. Copy Account SID, Auth Token, and phone number
4. Admin → App Config → Twilio → paste each value → Save
